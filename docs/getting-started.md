# Getting Started

## Installation and startup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run migrate`
3. `npm run seed`
4. `npm start`

## Setting up an API client

- Install an API client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
  > For you convenience, I have included a file called `weapon_quests_insomnia_collection.json` located at the root of the project. If you have chosen to use Insomnia to make the requests, you can just import the file and start testing.
